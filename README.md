currently being ported thankyou for your patience.


I would not have attempted this if Nigel Bree had not given me a
book on pascal algorithms.

thank you Nigel

thats four one more till bjarnes five.

I think java script chess is next.

then bug fixes and gui from c++ fixed for all then finally a rerite
of all five into more native oop for each language.

then stage 2

Machine learning from the gameState file.

Note on this version of the game.

Pascal is seriously cross platform these days and making gui interfaces
and applications is very easy and painless compared other languages due
to lazarus.

this version will hold both android and ios version of the game in its compile directory

when the gui has been developed.
